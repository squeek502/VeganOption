### Pufferfish

### Ender Pearl
frozen bubble + raw/liquid ender
- some sort of block to create a mini-end portal (ender rift)
- water flowing into the ender rift removes the water source block and replaces the portal block with a liquid ender source block
- must be done at night or there are negative consequencs (explosions seem too mundane?)
- perhaps negative consequence could be teleporting the player that placed the block to the block (exploitable? is that bad?)

## Misc things

Cook potato starch in a furnace to get Bioplastic?
http://green-plastics.net/posts/10/video-brandon121233/
used as the 'shaft' of faux feathers? might need more usage to justify it existing

Cook resin in a furance to get Rosin?

not sure what the potential uses would be; might be out of the scope of this mod

## Most things should have an in-world crafting method

### Frozen bubble
 - Soap (rosin + wax?) in a dispenser creates bubbles, bubbles touch ice (more specific than just a single ice block?) to become frozen bubbles

### Potato starch/oil/milk
 - Crush with a piston?
